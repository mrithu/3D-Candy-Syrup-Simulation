# 3D-Candy-Syrup-Simulation
By Mrithula KL and R Buvan Sankar
## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to accurately and convincingly simulate the motion of two
candy toruses rotating independently on their axes, while a syrup-like fluid seamlessly interacts
with the toruses' surfaces. Achieving a visually appealing and physically plausible representation
required addressing several technical challenges, including rotational dynamics, fluid simulation,
and the integration of these elements in a cohesive virtual environment.

## Tool
Blender3D, a powerful open-source 3D computer graphics software, was employed for the
simulation. Its comprehensive set of tools and features made it suitable for handling the
complexities of fluid animation.

## Key Features
1. All components were built from scratch, harnessing the innate capabilities of Blender3D.
From the candies to the syrup, none of the objects were imported from external sources
and all parameters were set manually.
2. The visually-appealing animation is accompanied by an apt, soothing background audio
that mimics sloshing of syrup.
3. Camera follows a predefined trajectory that highlights the desired views.

## Procedure
### Geometry Setup:
a. Candy Torus Models:

Create 3D models of the candy toruses using Blender's modeling tools.

Ensure accurate representation of the toruses' shapes and sizes.

b. Initial Conditions

Set up the initial conditions for the rotational motion of each torus.

Specify rotation axes, initial angular velocities, and orientations.

### Fluid Simulation Setup:
a. Fluid Properties:

Define properties for the syrup-like fluid, such as viscosity and density.

b. Particle System

Create a particle system to simulate the behavior of the fluid.

Adjust particle emission rates and lifetimes to control fluid density.

c. Fluid Simulation Settings:

Configure Blender's fluid simulation settings to achieve realistic fluid dynamics.

Define the domain for the fluid simulation and set boundary conditions.

### Rigid Body Dynamics for Toruses:
a. Rigid Body Physics:

Apply Blender's rigid body physics to the candy toruses.

Specify collision shapes and properties for each torus.

b. Independent Spinning:

Ensure that each torus spins independently on its defined axis.

Adjust mass, friction, and other parameters to achieve desired rotational behavior.

### Integration:
a. Fluids-Torus interaction:

Integrate the fluid simulation with the candy torus models.

b. Coordinate Systems:

Verify that coordinate systems align correctly between the fluid and torus simulations.

Adjust transformations if needed for seamless integration.

### Background Music Integration:
a. Audio File Selection:

Choose a suitable background music track for the animation.

Ensure the selected music complements the visual aesthetics and theme of the simulation.

b. Audio Editing Software:

Use an audio editing tool to trim or loop the music file for the desired duration.

Adjust volume levels and apply any necessary effects for a seamless blend.

### Camera Animation Setup:
a. Path Creation:

Design a predefined path for the camera to follow during the animation.

Utilize Blender's curve or path tools to create the camera's trajectory.

b. Camera Placement:

Position the camera at key points along the path to capture the desired views.

Adjust camera angles and orientations to highlight important simulation features.

c. Keyframe Animation:

Keyframe the camera's movement along the path at specific frames.

Ensure smooth transitions between keyframes for a fluid camera motion.

### Rendering and Visualisation:
a. Lighting Setup:

Configure lighting to enhance visual appeal throughout the camera's movement.

Consider adjusting lighting dynamically to accommodate changes in camera position.

b. Material and Texture Mapping:

Apply materials and textures to the toruses and fluid to achieve a realistic appearance.

Fine-tune shading and reflections for enhanced visual quality.

c. Audio Setup:

Integrate the edited background music into the animation project.

Synchronize the music with key events in the simulation for a cohesive experience.

### Optimization:
a. Real-time Performance:

Optimize the simulation for real-time performance, considering computational resources.

Adjust particle counts and simulation resolutions for a balance between quality and
speed.

### Validation and Testing:
a. Simulation Validation:

Conduct extensive testing to ensure the accuracy and realism of the simulation.

Validate fluid-torus interactions under various conditions.

b. Audio Testing:

Verify that the background music enhances the overall experience without overpowering the simulation sounds.

Confirm that the audio and camera movements are synchronized effectively.
